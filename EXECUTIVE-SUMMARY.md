# Executive Summary

> **Strategic transformation of procurement database: From 32% to 92% C-Suite report coverage**

## Project Overview

This comprehensive gap analysis delivers a systematic plan to transform procurement database capabilities, enabling automated C-Suite reporting while eliminating 80% of external data dependencies. The initiative represents a **$328K investment returning $10.2M over three years** with a 3.2-month payback period.

## üéØ Current State Assessment
